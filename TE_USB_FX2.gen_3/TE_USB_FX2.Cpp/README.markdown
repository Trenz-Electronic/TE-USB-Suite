# Trenz Electronic USB Suite
This repository contains projects and files relevant to Trenz Electronic modules equipped with a USB microcontroller.

TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI is the project that creates the API used in the example project TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI_SampleApplication.
Both projects have been set to compile for 32 bit, and are generated by Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express.

## FilesToImportForApplicationCpp<br />
FilesToImportForApplicationCpp contains files required to create a new C++ software project that use TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI.dll.
In particular, there are two header files: TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI.h and CyApi.h. This two files must be added in the new C++ software project under "Include Files".
The DLL32 subdirectory contains various files, but the only file necessary for a new C++ software project is TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI.dll that must be added under "Resource Files". The other files have been stored here for completness. 
The DLL64 subdirectory contains various files, but the only file necessary for a new C++ software project is TE_USB_FX2_CyAPI.dll that must be added under "Resource Files". The other files have been stored here for completness.
